# Installing Your Linux Distribution
## Choosing a Distribution
There are three officially supported distros at this time:
- Ubuntu
- OpenSUSE, and
- SLES

If you have problems with any of the supported functionality in any
of these distributions, you can get help from Canonical (for Ubuntu),
and SUSE Gmbh (for OpenSUSE and SLES). You can also ask questions on
a few sites, like reddit.com/r/bashonubuntuonwindows.

A number of unofficial distributions can be installed. Support for them
is limited to sites like reddit.com/r/bashonubuntuonwindows.

How do you choose a distro? If you are unsure, start with Ubuntu.
You can try others as well without losing anything you did to the
Ubuntu install.

Why did I recommend Ubuntu?
Microsoft worked with Canonical, the makers of Ubuntu, to create WSL.
More WSL functionality is provided for Ubuntu than any other distro.
For instance, you can install and run many GUI applications and a 
desktop on Ubuntu at this time, but you are unlikely to be able to do
so with any of the other distros.

However, if you are familiar with another distribution and will only be
using command line tools (bash, sed, awk, make, etc.), then choose that
distribution if available. You can always install Ubuntu or another
distro beside it.
