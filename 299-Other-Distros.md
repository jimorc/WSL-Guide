# Other Distros
There are a number of blog posts on the Internet
that describe how to install Linux distros
other than those available in Windows Store.
Unfortunately, almost all of them were written
for versions of Windows that included WSL as
a beta Windows feature and execute at least one
program that has been marked as deprecated. 

There are
also a few programs and scripts on GitHub that
purport to install various distros, but again
they tend to use deprecated programs and are
also not being actively maintained.

There is one blog post written after WSL became
a fully supported Windows feature that supposedly
will install Fedora and other distros. I ran into
a number of problems while attempting to perform
the install which left me with a Fedora system
that I could not install any packages on. I was
stuck with a system that ran only as root with
no password. The procedure described uses two
applications from GitHub, one of which cannot be
uninstalled. I cannot in all conscience recommend
the procedure.

My recommendation is to wait until other distros
appear in the Windows Store, or if you have the
capabilities, create your own procedure and
publish it.
