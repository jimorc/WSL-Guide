# Installing Distros on Windows 10
There are currently three distros available through the Windows Store:
- Ubuntu (16.04 LTS)
- OpenSUSE Leap 42, and
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12

A number of unofficial distros are also available because of work done by
a number of people. The instructions for installing these distros is 
different from the instructions for installing distros from the Windows
Store and in some cases, more than one way of installing these distros is
available. Because of this, I have
provided a page for installing each distro from the Windows Store and for
those distros that have more than one way of installing them. A general
page describing the installation of other distros is also provided.
