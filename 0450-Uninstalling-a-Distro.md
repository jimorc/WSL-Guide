# Uninstalling a Distro
There are two ways described in this guide for installing a Linux distro
in WSL:
  * installing a distro from the Windows Store; and,
  * installing a non-Windows Store distro using WSL-DistroLauncher.

The instructions for uninstalling a distro varies depending on which method
was used to install the distro. Each method for uninstalling a distro is
described below.

__Warning:__ All of your data (your home directory) is also deleted. You may
wish to save the contents of your home directory before uninstalling the
distro.
## Uninstall a Windows Store Distro
Distros that have been installed from Windows Store may be uninstalled like any
other app. That is, go to the Windows menu, right-click on the distro and
select *Uninstall*. Alternatively, you can uninstall by selecting 
*Settings->Apps & features*, then locate the distro in the list, select it,
and then click on the *Uninstall* button.

## Uninstall a Distro Installed with WSL-DistroLauncher
The following instructions are for uninstalling Arch Linux. For
any other distro that was installed using WSL-DistroLauncher,
make changes as appropriate.

1. Start cmd.exe or Powershell.
2. At the prompt, enter:

  * cd \<directory containing Arch Linux>
  * Arch clean

Your Arch Linux distro will be unregistered with WSL and uninstalled.
