# Chapter 2: Installing and Uninstalling WSL and Distributions
Before using WSL and your favorite Linux distribution, you must first
enable WSL and install one or more Linux distributions. It would also
be useful to know how to uninstall Linux distributions and how to disable
WSL. Those are the topics of this chapter.

This chapter will specifically look at:
- [Requirements for running WSL](0200-Requirements.md).
- Enabling WSL.
- Installing Linux distros on Windows 10. There are a number of
officially supported distros, but it is possible to install a large
number of other distros as well.
- Installing Linux distros on Windows Server.
- Upgrading to a newer distro release.
- Uninstalling a Linux distro.
- Disabling WSL.

So let's begin with the requirements.
